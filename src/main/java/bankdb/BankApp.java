	 * Hello, there is an assignment I'm struggling with which deals with the
	 * concepts of inheritance, polymorphism and interface.
	 * 
	 * here is the assignment:
	 * 
	 * For this project, you shall define a new class BankDatabase. The BankDatabase
	 * contains the bank account information for all accounts including saving
	 * accounts and checking accounts. The customer names are passed as “firstname
	 * lastname”. Your application must split the string into two separate strings
	 * for first name and last name (Hint: use the split() method). If you decide to
	 * use an array to store the bank accounts, you can assume there will be maximum
	 * of 100 bank accounts in the Bank Database. Alternatively, you can consider
	 * using an ArrayList in which case its size can grow automatically as new bank
	 * accounts are added. BankDatabase class implements the following methods:
	 * 
	 * BankDatabase() – constructor
	 * 
	 * void creatCheckingAccount(String customerName, String ssn, float deposit) –
	 * This method creates a checking account
	 * 
	 * void creatSavingAccount(String customerName, String ssn, float deposit) –
	 * This method creates a saving account
	 * 
	 * void print() – This method prints the bank account information in the
	 * database in ascending order of the account balances.
	 * 
	 * void applyIntrest – This methods applies interest to all bank accounts. The
	 * interest for each type of account is the same as project 5.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Make the following updates to the BankAccount super class:
	 * 
	 * 1) Make the BankAccount super class an abstract class and make applyInterest
	 * an abstract method.
	 * 
	 * 2) The BankAccount super class shall implement the Comparable Interface. You
	 * shall implement the compareTo method to provide the means to sort the bank
	 * accounts in the ascending order of the account balance.
	 * 
	 * Identify the objects for this application and define each class attribute
	 * with proper access qualifier. You can use the “main” method shown below to
	 * test your application. The expected output is also provided.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * public class BankApp {
	 * 
	 * public static void main(String[] args) {
	 * 
	 * BankDatabase acctDatabase = new BankDatabase();
	 * 
	 * acctDatabase.createCheckingAccount("Alin Parker", "123-45-6789", 20000.0f);
	 * 
	 * acctDatabase.createSavingAccount("Mary Jones", "987-65-4321", 15000.0f);
	 * 
	 * acctDatabase.createSavingAccount("John Smith", "123-45-6789", 12000.0f);
	 * 
	 * acctDatabase.print();
	 * 
	 * acctDatabase.applyInterest();
	 * 
	 * acctDatabase.print();
	 * 
	 * }
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ======= expected output =============
	 * 
	 * Succesfully created account for Alin Parker Account Number 5435736518
	 * 
	 * Succesfully created account for Mary Jones Account Number 3612979581
	 * 
	 * Succesfully created account for John Smith Account Number 6998050883
	 * 
	 * John Smith, accn #: 6998050883, Balance $12000.0
	 * 
	 * Mary Jones, accn #: 3612979581, Balance $15000.0
	 * 
	 * Alin Parker, accn #: 5435736518, Balance $20000.0
	 * 
	 * John Smith, accn #: 6998050883, Balance $12600.0
	 * 
	 * Mary Jones, accn #: 3612979581, Balance $15750.0
	 * 
	 * Alin Parker, accn #: 5435736518, Balance $20200.0
